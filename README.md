# Relppod-Effect
Doppler Effect but Backwards

This code includes a program to calculate and play the reverse of the doppler effect for a 440hz tone. When velocity (mph), standoff distance (ft) and run distance (ft) are given, the program will calculate the correct tone.

Videos of a test case are provided in the folder expereiment
velocity: 30mph
standoff distance: 24ft
run distance: 50ft
